Front End:
- Next.js
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

Backend: 
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Architecture

The overall architecture is a front end written in React, connected to a Node.js backend with a MongoDB database.

The MongoDB schema takes care of the projects and the tickets within each project.

## Maintainability

Every component is responsible for it's own function

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
